Parameter
fd: file descriptor of the file from which data is to be read.
buf: buffer to read data from
count: length of the buffer

Return Value

return Number of bytes read on success
return 0 on reaching the end of file
return -1 on error
return -1 on signal interrupt

Important Points

buf: needs to point to a valid memory location with a length not smaller than the specified size because of overflow.
fd: should be a valid file descriptor returned from open() to perform the read operation because if fd is NULL then the read should generate an error.
count is the requested number of bytes read, while the return value is the actual number of bytes read. Also, some times read system call should read fewer bytes than count
