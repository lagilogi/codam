Hello and welcome to my Codam Project repo.

This repo is used for both a backup of the Codam projects, as well as my portfolio for potential employers.

Even though some of the projects may have been finished long ago, I might occassionally add changes as I learn more about coding.

Do note that all projects have been written with Norminette's rules, which allows us to use only a very select few of functions, 
and also prohibits us from using things like 'for-loops', writing more than 25 lines per function & more.

Some projects are group projects, which means that their original repo is seperate from this one. For the sake of overview,
I've added the finished group projects directly. To find the original repo with all commits & branches, etc, you can find them here:

- Minishell: https://github.com/mlubber/minishell_42

Best regards,
Wouter
