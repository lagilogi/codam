Hello and welcome to my Codam Project repo.

This repo is used for both a backup of the Codam projects, as well as my portfolio for potential employers.

Even though some of the projects may have been finished long ago, I might occassionally add changes as I learn more about coding.

Do note that all projects have been written with Norminette's rules, which allows us to use only a very select few of functions, 
and also prohibits us from using things like 'for-loops', writing more than 25 lines per function & much more.

Best regards,
Wouter
